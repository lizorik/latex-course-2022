# latex-course-2022
This repository contains .md file, presentation and document, made on Latex via Overleaf by Elizaveta K.

The Latex course has been completed, the story of the work done will be described in this report.
The very first and potential acquaintance with Latex began in those moments when my classmates told me that almost all homework was written in it. Then I thought how cool it is to do such neat and clear homework. After that I began to notice that not only students use such a wonderful platform, but also teachers - whether it's a simple homework or a test, a syllabus or a presentation. Interest in how all the same work is done, on the trick of which high-quality and accurate documents and presentations in PDF format are obtained, prompted me to choose this mini-course in the summer. The mini-course is called "".
In this part of the report, I will describe the main points and tips on how to work with this platform for beginners in order to understand all the details and features.
To begin with, I recommend starting by exploring the Overleaf website. This is a fairly high-quality platform for working with and studying all the features of Latex. It includes fourteen different modules: Overleaf guides, References and Citations, LaTeX Basics, Mathematics, Figures and tables, Presentations,Languages, Field specific, Document structure, Formatting, Fonts, Commands, Class files, Advanced TeX/LaTeX. Moreover, there is even an opportunity to get acquainted with Latex in 30 minutes.
After getting acquainted with this platform, I suggest starting a practice, namely, creating some kind of official document, for example: a scientific article, a project report or an article. Why an official document? Because the creation of such a document covers most of the main functions of LaTeX. Next thing to do is to create new project(blank project). Once you have created new project, let start with deciding a document class using \documentclass function. Atricle, report, letter and many other classes can be used. More information about it can be found via Overleaf. 
As every official document contains title page, your practice should begin with it. Learn the details of creation and formatting and start coding. After that, table ob contents is recommended to be realized. Find more information about realisation, use \tableofcontents function. 
The main thing to suggest here is to not write all the text in main.tex, but to create new file per each part of table of contents and include them using \input function. This will greatly simplify the work and the code will look neat and clear.
Further actions are chosen by a trainee. However, main things are recommended: try to work with tables and their formatting; insert images and work with their position; realise several interesting types of charts, for example bar charts and pie plots; try different formats of quotes and footnotes. It is necessary to practice with mathematical formulas, preferably with complex. 
For more practice proof of theorem or chemical formulas may be realised. At the end of your document bibliography or references page is needed to be coded. There are a lot of formats, so one suitable can be chosen. 
At this stage, the practice with the official document comes to the finish. At the end, you will get a high-quality and very useful document for practice.
The next part of the mini-course is to create a presentation. It can be either beamer class or powerdot class. For instance, beamer class, which is a powerful and flexible LaTeX class to create great looking presentations, is chosen.
Work with presentation begins with creating a new project. You can starts from scratch, using Blank project, or choose ‘presentation’ and analyze all provided styles and types of presentations and use them. I started from scratch, using \documentclass{beamer} function. The next thing to do is to understand how new slides are created. In order to do that, practice with creating a minimal two-sided presentation with title page and second page with any text and name. After compilation, a two-page PDF file will be produced. The first page is the title page, and the second one contains sample content. Here we understand that the frame environment creates the second slide, the self-descriptive command \frametitle{My title} is optional. Once we have tried simple format, let try complete one. Beginning with title page, advanced and full slide is created, containing name of presentation in a frame using \title[My Presentation] {Name of your presentation}; subtitle using \subtitle; authors name with subscriptions using \author[Alex, Ben]{A.~B.~Alex\inst{1} \and J.~Ben\inst{2}}, where \inst{1} command that puts a superscript to reference the institution where each author works; institute and faculty using \institute[HSE]{\inst{1}Faculty of… ; date using \date[MP 2021]{My Presentation, July 2022}; logo of your choice using \logo{\includegraphics…}. 
However, there is another way to complete the title page. You can paste picture on your choice as the background using \pgfdeclareimage[width=\paperwidth]{title}{images/oill.jpg}, create a simple and stylish title using \title[CBD super]{Friends With Benefits:   Skincare and CBD} , declare author’s name and its degree, faculty and university using 
\author%
{%
    \sc{Name}\\
    \textit{Degree}
}
\institute%
{%
    \textit{institute}\\
    \textit{University of Oxford}
}, and place a date. 
Next stage is to use all the features learned in previous part, where work with official document was completed, in your presentation. Here you can paste any charts or plots, any pictures, any tables, mathematical formula of your choice. Moreover, as for the appearance of the presentation, the colors and themes can be chosen from the huge number that can be found on the Overleaf website. For example, theme can be declared using \usetheme{Madrid}, and color can be stated using \usecolortheme{beaver}.
Despite the fact that all necessary features were described and learned earlier, Latex presentations can provide several interesting and new points, that are extremely useful for everyone. For example, in a presentation is a good practice to highlight the important points to make it easier for your audience to identify the main topic. Use \begin{alertblock}{Important to know} in red box,  or \begin{block}{Your topic} in blue box. Moreover, if you need to specify the meaning of abbreviation, use \item[HSE] Higher School of Economics. Also, to highlight any word use \alert{my word}. 
At this stage, the practice with the presentation features and its creation comes to the finish. At the end, you will get a high-quality and very useful presentation in PDF format.
In conclusion, I will list the work done point by point.
LaTex features and important points are analyzed and understood
Official document, namely Project Report is done in the best way with PDF file at finish
Presentation is done with a use of large number of instruments, format and appearance features are tried
I recon that this course is very necessary and useful both for students and for broadening  horizons. This is a very convenient platform, which has absolutely all the necessary parameters and functions for the perfect writing of this or that document in a relatively short time. I am satisfied with my results, I can say that I tried and implemented most of the features, practicing with formatting on different types of documents.
