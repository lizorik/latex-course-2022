Time series forecasting is the best choice to work with quantifiable data, particularly the stock exchanges. The digital age has greatly motivated people to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges, where the main topic of interest is the first cryptocurrency developed– Bitcoin (BTC), which is paving the way as a disruptive technology gradually declaring competition to immortalized financial payment systems that have been in place for many decades. Cryptocurrency’s rate is not constant but continuously changing. Bitcoin prices are influenced by the factors such as the supply of Bitcoin and the market’s demand for it, news developments, the cost of producing a bitcoin through the mining process. One of the most prevalent solutions to this problem is forecasting. Time series forecasting may provide the most innovative opportunity to predict Bitcoin exchange rates for investors and academic researchers alike. This paper researches the existing methods and models to forecast data and further develops an algorithm for trading with accurately sending ‘Buy’ and ‘Sell’ signals. The research is done on Bitcoin exchange rate to US dollars (BTC-USD) per-hour data of Close Price over 97 days period from 2021-03-20 to 2021-06-27. The methodology of the project is based on five time series forecasting models: ARMA, ARIMA, ARIMAX and Prophet (Facebook Inc.). As a result, models are predicting the data, representing the trend of Bitcoin market prices.
