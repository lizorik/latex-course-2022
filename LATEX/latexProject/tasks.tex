The target of this research is to develop a trading algorithm and forecasting model and conduct an empirical analysis. 
Project objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data preparation – data is defined for the required time and processed for analysis.
    \item Forecasting models research – four models are implemented according to found metrics, the best model is determined by quality metrics.
    \item Trading algorithm development – based on the best model, the trading algorithm that predicts the future price based on historical data is developed.
\end{enumerate}
