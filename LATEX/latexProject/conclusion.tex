Finally, the project ‘Time series forecasting’, which goal is to predict Bitcoin close price using time series forecasting models is done. The main tasks are fulfilled, namely: data is processed for analysis and classified; three out of four models (ARMA, ARIMA, Prophet) are implemented and the best model is determined by one of the most appropriate quality metrics. The several issues to struggle with are finding an appropriate exogeneous factor of ARIMAX model suitable for given per-hour Bitcoin close price data, and negative profit of best chosen by quality metrics ARIMA model. The only one ARMA model got the positive profit.
