\begin{itemize}
    \item Time series is a set of observations obtained with equal intervals between them.
    \item  Forecasting model is trained and tested framework that makes predictions based on past and present data.
    \item Cryptocurrency is a virtual currency with authenticated transactions based on decentralized system secured by cryptography. 
    \item Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be sent person-to-person on the Bitcoin network without the need of a central server and mediators. 
    \item Stationary time series is time series which distribution properties are stable all over the time.
    \item Autoregressive model (AR) is a representation of a random process. The autoregressive model specifies that the output depends on the previous inputs and a stochastic term therefore making it a stochastic differential equation. 
    \item Moving Average model (MA) is a stationary model. The moving average is a linear regression of the current value against interferences the in the series.
